## Project Description
This project is a web application that allows you to connect with star wars data. You will be able to see a list of all the people and check for the information of each one.

## Technologies used
For the front I use Reactjs with some react hooks standar and for the api I use GraphQl to load data.

# Setup and Running instructions.

First, clone the repository and open a console in the project route
Second, install dependencies with `npm install`
Then, start running the app with `npm start`
Finally, your pc will deploy the app at [http://localhost:3000]. Perhaps, it will open by default, but if not, open on your browser: `http://localhost:3000` and enjoy it!
